# List ADT

**Note: this document is best viewed in preview mode in VSCode (ctrl+shift+v)**. 

## Introduction
For this exercise you will implement the List ADT using C++.You will implement a version that uses an array (dynamicly resizes), and linked data. I have provided the interface for this implementation.

## Requirements:
- **Do not change the interface** to accommodate your coding style or your solution.
- The name of the classes you create should be ***ArrayList*** and ***LinkedList*** 
- Implement them as templated classes that inherits the interface.
- Thoroughly test your program. Use the test.h file that we created in class.
- YYou should test with a variable of type ***List*** and an object of the type under test.
- Use the coding conventions taught in class.

## Submission:
- Copy all .cpp and .h files into a directory called *username_list*. Replace "username" with your Mt SAC username.
- Compress the directory using Zip, RAR, TAR, 7z, or any other program that creates a zip file
